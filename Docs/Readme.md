When we were given this project during week 2 of the CS4431 module, we first decided to brainstorm as a team to come up with as many potential ideas as possible. As the project description was quite open ended, we had the freedom to choose whatever project we wanted, provided it involved using Java. We used the movable whiteboards to share and communicate each of our ideas during frequent project meetings. We weighed up the pros and cons of each idea, assessed whether we would have the technical ability to complete a given idea, and also investigated whether or not it would be possible to complete the project in the time available. After a lengthy period of debate, we settled on this idea - a game that would teach people how to use Git in a fun and interactive way.

Our primary objective is to educate people on how to use the basic commands on Git in an interactive and rewarding environment. The terminal can often be intimidating for beginners and cause them to skip essential details on how to use this collaboration tool.  We will create a game using Java to solve this problem. We will create multiple levels to teach people the basics of Git. We plan to have a storyline behind each level and a user-friendly GUI to keep our users entertained.  In each level, the user / player will be required to input different Git commands based on the information provided to them during the game. To complete a level, the player must successfully input a number of correct git commands.
